# Desert Escape
## A 2-D Python Platform Game
This is a game I developed to learn the Python language and have fun with it. Desert Escape is a simple 2-D platform game in which the cowboy navigates the landscape avoiding hazards like cacti and crows. 

Note: I do not own any of the artwork, sound effects, or music found in this game.
